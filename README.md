# Multithreading
This is multithreading script!

## For example ISS logger:
Reading ISS position will be in one thread. Writing to csv will be in another thread.
Make a real-time plot visualizing the ISS position (x = longitude, y = latitutude). Plotting will be also in different thread
Read, write and visualize with different frequencies (eg. read every second, write every 5 seconds, visualize every 3 seconds).

## Very basic updating plot example:
You can try matplotlib animation.
